# Introduction

This guide asumes you are familiar with the term "monorepo". I guess you would not have ended up here otherwise. But for the sake of completeness, here is a quote from wikipedia:

> In revision control systems, a monorepo (syllabic abbreviation of monolithic repository) is a software development strategy where code for many projects are stored in the same repository. As of 2017 this software engineering practice was over a decade old, but had only recently been named.

If you want to know more about the benefits of using a monorepo or why you should not use a monorepo, here is a very short summary:

- 🍪 Simplified organization (single configuration for linting, building, ...)
- 🍪 Simplified dependency management 
- 🍪 "Atomic changes" (single PR to coordinate changes affecting multiple modules)
- 🍪 Enforced architectural boundaries (modules instead of just folders)
- 🍪 Better discoverability of related modules

- 🍋 May become too large
- 🍋 Performance issues (number of commits)

In order to make lemonade out the aforementioned downsides, just remember that you're not Google, Twitter or any other super large organization. You don't need to have *one* monorepo for your whole company. Rather use monorepos to group things that belong together. A good example for this is [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) or [Atlassian's Atlaskit](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). 

Within your company each team can have its own monorepo. This way, you organize your software by domain/context and it is still clear who has responsibility for the code.
